# General

this project is a helper SDK for building various kinds of agentic + ai solutions

main goal is to give good DX and make it fast and easy to build POCs that also are of good quality
and something you can easily get to production as well


# style stuff:

- use absolute imports
- comments are a code smell, avoid docstrings too if not adding anything
- empty __init__.py unless otherwise specified
- no star imports
- always use types
- use uv and ruff


# logging

this is the way to obtain the logger:

```
from siili_ai_sdk.utils.init_logger import init_logger

logger = init_logger(__name__)
```
