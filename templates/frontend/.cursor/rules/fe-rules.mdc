general stuff:
- zod for type guards
- use function for named functions instead of const
- always use named exports and export them while declaring the functions
- name react component props as "Props" unless conflict or need to export it, use interface instead of type
- focus on clean code. small files small functions
- comments are a code smell
- zustand for type management
- axios based api clients for interacing with backend, should extend BaseApiClient
- do NOT add unnecessary index.ts files
- do NOT use null types

basic folders:

src/stores -> zustand stores
src/api -> interactinons with backend
src/components -> atomic reusable components that are not tied to a particular view. if consisting one main component and multiple subcomponents name the main component SomeComponent/SomeComponent.tsx and put the subcomponents to the same folder
src/views -> non reusable views. if there are components used only there put them in same folder
src/utils -> random shit

---------

after youve done something complex in agent mode ALWAYS run `yarn tsc && yarn lint --fix && yarn test`
