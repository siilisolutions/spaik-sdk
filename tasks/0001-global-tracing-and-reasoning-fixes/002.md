# 002: Add agent instance ID to tracing

## Context

Currently, agents are only identified by their class name in traces. When multiple instances of the same agent class exist, or when an agent makes multiple calls, there's no way to correlate traces in observability backends (Datadog, OpenTelemetry, etc.). Each agent instance needs a unique identifier (UUID) that flows through to the trace sink for correlation purposes.

The LocalTraceSink can ignore this ID (its file naming is fine as-is), but custom sinks need access to it.

## Related Code

Existing files/patterns to reference or extend:
- `spaik_sdk/agent/base_agent.py` - Where UUID generation needs to happen, already generates AgentTrace in constructor
- `spaik_sdk/tracing/agent_trace.py` - Needs to accept and store instance ID, passes to TraceSink on save
- `spaik_sdk/tracing/trace_sink.py` - Abstract interface, save_trace signature needs new parameter
- `spaik_sdk/tracing/local_trace_sink.py` - Needs to accept new parameter but can ignore it
- `spaik_sdk/tracing/noop_trace_sink.py` - Created in step 001, needs same signature update

## Reuse Opportunities

- Python's uuid module provides uuid4() for random UUID generation - standard library, no dependencies
- The pattern of passing identifiers through constructors already exists in BaseAgent (e.g., system_prompt flows to AgentTrace)
- TraceSink implementations already follow consistent interface pattern

## Deliverables

- BaseAgent generates a UUID on construction and stores it as agent_instance_id
- AgentTrace constructor accepts an optional agent_instance_id parameter
- AgentTrace stores the instance ID and passes it to TraceSink.save_trace calls
- TraceSink.save_trace method signature updated to include agent_instance_id parameter
- LocalTraceSink.save_trace accepts the new parameter but ignores it (file naming unchanged)
- NoOpTraceSink.save_trace accepts the new parameter (does nothing anyway)
- BaseAgent passes its instance ID to AgentTrace during construction

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] BaseAgent has an agent_instance_id attribute that is a UUID
- [x] Each BaseAgent instance has a unique agent_instance_id (two instances differ)
- [x] AgentTrace constructor accepts agent_instance_id parameter
- [x] AgentTrace.save passes agent_instance_id to TraceSink.save_trace
- [x] TraceSink.save_trace signature includes agent_instance_id parameter
- [x] LocalTraceSink accepts agent_instance_id but file naming is unchanged
- [x] Creating AgentTrace without instance_id still works (generates its own UUID for backward compatibility)
- [x] Unit tests verify instance ID generation and propagation
