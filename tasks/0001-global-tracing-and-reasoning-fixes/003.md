# 003: Fix Google Gemini reasoning disable

## Context

When users set `reasoning=False` on an agent using a Google Gemini model (like Gemini 2.5 Flash), the thinking/reasoning is not actually disabled. This is because Gemini models have thinking enabled by default, and the current implementation only sets `thinking_budget` when reasoning is explicitly enabled - it does nothing when reasoning is disabled.

According to LangChain documentation and the Gemini API, you must explicitly set `thinking_budget=0` to disable thinking. Simply omitting the parameter leaves the default behavior (thinking enabled).

## Related Code

Existing files/patterns to reference or extend:
- `spaik_sdk/models/factories/google_factory.py` - The file to modify, contains get_model_specific_config method
- `spaik_sdk/models/factories/anthropic_factory.py` - Shows the correct pattern: handles both reasoning=True and reasoning=False cases explicitly
- `spaik_sdk/models/llm_config.py` - Contains the LLMConfig class with the reasoning field

## Reuse Opportunities

- The Anthropic factory already demonstrates the correct pattern: when reasoning is disabled, it sets temperature instead of thinking config. Google factory should follow similar structure but set thinking_budget=0 explicitly
- The conditional structure already exists in google_factory.py, just needs an else branch

## Deliverables

- Update GoogleModelFactory.get_model_specific_config to handle reasoning=False case
- When config.reasoning is False, explicitly set thinking_budget to 0 in the model config
- When config.reasoning is False, explicitly set include_thoughts to False

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] When config.reasoning is True, thinking_budget is set to the configured budget value (existing behavior)
- [x] When config.reasoning is True, include_thoughts is set to True (existing behavior)
- [x] When config.reasoning is False, thinking_budget is explicitly set to 0
- [x] When config.reasoning is False, include_thoughts is set to False
- [x] Unit tests verify the model config output for both reasoning=True and reasoning=False
- [x] Integration test confirms Gemini API call includes thinking_budget=0 when reasoning disabled
