# MIT License: A Business Guide

## TL;DR

MIT is a very common, permissive open-source license. Use it freely in commercial or internal products; you can keep your own code closed. Your only real obligation is to keep attribution; there's no warranty or liability, and no copyleft ("viral") requirements. In short: extremely standard OSS license — nothing to see here.
